- Process: Instance of a programme or an application
- Thread: a sequence of instructions
- each process has at least one thread
- Race condition: multiple threads are computing to modify same data
- Visibility problem: a thread changes some data but aren't visible to the other threads

 * Thread Safety Strategies:
  - Confinement: not to share data across threads (restricting each thread to have its own data)
  - Immutability: using unchanged object like Strings
  - Synchronizations( not a good practise): preventing multiple threads from accessing same data concurrently using
    locks where only one thread at a time execute that part(but code will run sequentially
    and leading to deadlock: where 2 threads waits each other indefinitely

  - Atomic objects: this classes be executed as one single atomic operation
  - Partitioning: dividing data into segments that can be accesses concurrently
