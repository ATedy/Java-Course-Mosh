- Generic classes/methods : for creating general purpose classes n methods w/c can be used with different kind of Objects
- Type erasure: during compilation, will erase the generic type <T> with actual class, default being Object
unless constraints are applied
- we apply constraints with the extends kw and this ensures only given type will be used or its subtypes as arguments
- WildCards: with wild cards we can typecast generic types
